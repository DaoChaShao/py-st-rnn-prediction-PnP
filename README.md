**INTRODUCTION**
---
This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for **next-word prediction** and **text
sequence generation**. We use the classic literary work **"Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen** as the training
corpus. By preprocessing the raw text (tokenization, vocabulary building, sequence creation), the model learns
linguistic patterns and generates new sequences in a similar style. The goal is to train an effective LSTM language
model capable of predicting the next word and generating text continuations.

This project is a practical case study for **NLP beginners**, focusing on sequence modeling, language modeling, and deep
learning-based text generation. A comprehensive Streamlit-based web application for text sequence prediction using
RNN/LSTM models. This tool provides an end-to-end pipeline from raw text preprocessing to model training and evaluation,
specifically designed for next-word prediction tasks in natural language processing.

**DATA DESCRIPTION**
---

1. **Source**:
   [Kaggle - LSTM Next Word Prediction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hakim11/lstm-next-word-prediction-data)
2. **Content**: Full English text of *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen
3. **Language**: English (Modern English literary text)
4. **Task Type**: Next Word Prediction / Text Generation
5. **Preprocessing Steps**:

- Text cleaning (removing punctuation and special characters)
- Vocabulary construction
- Splitting text into fixed-length input sequences with target labels

6. **Applications**:

- Train an LSTM-based **language model**
- Perform **text generation experiments** (e.g., feed an opening phrase and let the model generate continuations)

7. **NLP Part**

- load the model named `en_core_web_sm` for English tokenization locally by running the command:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

**FEATURES**
---

- **Text Preprocessing**: Automated text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization using spaCy
- **Vocabulary Building**: TensorFlow Tokenizer integration for dictionary creation
- **N-gram Sequences**: Generation of sequential training data with configurable n-gram lengths
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Multi-layer LSTM with Dropout and BatchNormalization
- **Model Training**: Customizable training parameters with real-time metrics monitoring
- **Interactive UI**: Streamlit-based interface with step-by-step workflow
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for future use
