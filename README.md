**INTRODUCTION**
---
This project demonstrates how to use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for **next-word prediction** and **text
sequence generation**. We use the classic literary work **"Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen** as the training
corpus. By preprocessing the raw text (tokenization, vocabulary building, sequence creation), the model learns
linguistic patterns and generates new sequences in a similar style. The goal is to train an effective LSTM language
model capable of predicting the next word and generating text continuations.

This project is a practical case study for **NLP beginners**, focusing on sequence modeling, language modeling, and deep
learning-based text generation.

**DATA DESCRIPTION**
---

- **Source**:
  [Kaggle - LSTM Next Word Prediction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hakim11/lstm-next-word-prediction-data)
- **Content**: Full English text of *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen
- **Language**: English (Modern English literary text)
- **Task Type**: Next Word Prediction / Text Generation
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
    - Text cleaning (removing punctuation and special characters)
    - Vocabulary construction
    - Splitting text into fixed-length input sequences with target labels
- **Applications**:
    - Train an LSTM-based **language model**
    - Perform **text generation experiments** (e.g., feed an opening phrase and let the model generate continuations)
- **NLP Part**
    - Run the command:
      ```bash
      python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
      ```
      to load the model named `en_core_web_sm` for English tokenization.

This guide outlines the steps to automatically generate and maintain a project changelog using git-changelog.

1. Install the required dependencies with the command `pip install git-changelog`.
2. Run the command `pip show git-changelog` or `pip show git-changelog | grep Version` to check whether the changelog
   package has been installed and its version.
3. Prepare the configuration file of `pyproject.toml` at the root of the file.
4. The changelog style is [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
5. Run the command `git-changelog`, creating the `Changelog.md` file.
6. Add the file `Changelog.md` to version control with the command `git add Changelog.md` or using the UI interface.
7. Run the command `git-changelog --output CHANGELOG.md` committing the changes and updating the changelog.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository with the command `git push origin main` or using the UI interface.
